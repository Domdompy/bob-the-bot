  f'I know that we may be surrounded by people and yet feel all alone. But I believe that we don’t have the reason to feel lonely when there’s the entire world inside us. Sometimes we simply need to take a break from everyone and experience and love ourselves. Look into yourself. You’re strong and beautiful and you’re a thousand times enough.',
  'I’m so sorry to hear that you feel all alone. If it makes you feel better most of us feel that way at some point. Your desires, fears, and sorrows are universal. So is your loneliness. We all feel lost sometimes. I know how strong you are and I know you’ll overcome this challenge.',
  'Hey, I appreciate that you shared your feelings with me. I want you to know that I am here if you need to talk about it. I’m keen to know why you feel lonely? Do you feel isolated when you’re with people or do you simply not see enough people?',
  'Oh I am sorry to hear that. May I ask, what makes you feel that way? What kind of thoughts are you having?',
  'You deserve love and care like anyone else. Don’t be too harsh on yourself. Think of what you would say to a loved one if he or she was facing a difficult situation. Then, direct this compassionate response toward yourself. I hope this will help you understand that you’re not all alone.',
